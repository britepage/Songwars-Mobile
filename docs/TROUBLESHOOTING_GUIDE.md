# SongWars Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues, their root causes, and solutions for the SongWars application.

## üö® Critical Issues

### Audio Loading Failures & "NotSupportedError"

**Symptoms:**
- Battle screen shows only one song or no songs
- Console errors: "NotSupportedError: The element has no supported sources"
- Intermittent failures, especially on mobile devices
- Songs sometimes work, sometimes don't

**Root Cause: Supabase Usage Limits**
- **Egress Overage:** When your project exceeds the 5GB monthly data transfer limit
- **Storage Restrictions:** Supabase temporarily restricts file access when limits are exceeded
- **Mobile Impact:** Mobile devices consume more bandwidth, triggering restrictions faster

**Evidence:**
- Database shows 76 active songs with valid URLs
- Storage dashboard shows only 1 file
- Project shows "Exceeding usage limits" warning
- Files return 404 errors intermittently

**Solutions:**
1. **Immediate Relief:** Take a break from using the app (1-7 days)
2. **Monitor Usage:** Check Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Usage page
3. **Upgrade Plan:** Consider moving to a usage-based plan
4. **Error Handling:** Use the built-in error fallback system (already implemented)

**Prevention:**
- Monitor egress usage in Supabase Dashboard
- Set up usage alerts
- Optimize file sizes and caching strategies

## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed Issues

### Audio Timeout Management Bugs (FIXED)

**Previous Symptoms:**
- Songs with start time 0 didn't reset properly after playback
- 30-second timeouts didn't reset when pausing and restarting audio
- Spam-clicking play buttons caused songs to stop prematurely
- Switching between songs caused interference from previous timeouts
- Multiple timeouts accumulated causing memory leaks

**Root Cause:**
- Missing timeout ID storage and management
- No timeout clearing when pausing/stopping audio
- Timeouts continued running even after audio was stopped

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added proper timeout management to all audio components
- Implemented timeout ID storage and clearing functions
- Enhanced cleanup on pause, stop, and error scenarios
- Fixed memory leaks and timeout interference

**Components Fixed:**
- `useTaggedSongs.ts` - Tagged songs audio playback
- `leaderboard.vue` - Leaderboard audio playback  
- `BattleAnimation.vue` - Battle system audio playback
- `WaveformSelectorDual.vue` - Audio preview functionality

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - All audio timeout issues have been fixed

## üîß Common Issues

### Battle System Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Battle button doesn't respond

### Profile Creation Issues

**Symptoms:**
- New users can't create profiles
- Profile updates fail
- Database errors related to profiles

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Database:** Verify profiles table exists and has correct schema
2. **Check RLS:** Ensure Row Level Security policies are correct
3. **Check Auth:** Verify Supabase Auth is properly configured

### Song Upload Failures

**Symptoms:**
- File uploads fail
- Songs don't appear in dashboard
- Storage errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Check File Size:** Ensure files are under storage limits
2. **Check Format:** Verify audio format is supported
3. **Check Storage:** Verify storage bucket permissions
4. **Check Quota:** Ensure storage quota hasn't been exceeded

## üì± Mobile-Specific Issues

### Audio Loading on Mobile

**Symptoms:**
- Audio fails to load more frequently on mobile
- Battle system works inconsistently
- Network timeouts

**Root Causes:**
- **Network Instability:** Mobile networks are less reliable
- **Bandwidth Consumption:** Mobile browsers use more bandwidth
- **Supabase Restrictions:** Mobile usage can trigger limits faster

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Error Fallback:** The built-in error handling system
2. **Stable Connection:** Use WiFi when possible
3. **Monitor Usage:** Check if Supabase limits are being exceeded

## üóëÔ∏è Soft Delete System Issues

### Songs Not Appearing in Trash

**Symptoms:**
- Deleted songs don't appear in trash view
- Trash tab shows no songs
- Songs appear to be permanently deleted

**Root Causes:**
- **Trash Expiration:** Songs may have expired from trash (10-day limit)
- **Database Issues:** Soft delete RPC may not be working properly
- **RLS Policies:** Row Level Security may be blocking access

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Expiration:** Trash expires after 10 days automatically
2. **Verify RPC:** Test `get_my_trashed_songs()` function
3. **Check RLS:** Verify RLS policies allow access to trashed songs
4. **Manual Cleanup:** Use `manual_purge_expired_trash()` for testing

### Restore Functionality Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Restore button doesn't work
- Songs remain in trash after restore attempt
- Restored songs don't appear in active rotation

**Root Causes:**
- **State Preservation:** Restore preserves original churn state
- **Churn Integration:** Eliminated songs (week 4) remain inactive after restore
- **Database Issues:** Restore RPC may not be working properly

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Churn State:** Verify song's current churn week
2. **Test RPC:** Test `restore_song()` function directly
3. **Verify State:** Check if song was eliminated at week 4
4. **Manual Update:** Use direct database update if needed

- **Database Issues:** Churn functions may have errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Cron:** Verify weekly-churn function cron schedule
2. **Test Function:** Use `process_weekly_churn()` manually
3. **Verify Data:** Check churn_events table for processing logs
4. **Check Functions:** Verify all churn RPCs are working

### Leaderboard Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Songs appearing in multiple weeks
- Songs appearing in both week and Hall of Fame
- Incorrect week assignments

**Root Causes:**
- **Filtering Logic:** Leaderboard filtering may not be working
- **Churn State:** Songs may have incorrect churn state
- **Database Issues:** Leaderboard functions may have errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Filtering:** Verify leaderboard filtering logic
2. **Test Functions:** Test leaderboard RPCs directly
3. **Verify State:** Check song churn state in database
4. **Check Integration:** Ensure churn system integration is working
