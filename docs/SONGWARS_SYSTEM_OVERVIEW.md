# SongWars System Overview

## üéØ Platform Summary
SongWars is a comprehensive music competition platform that enables anonymous song battles, automated competition management, and community-driven content moderation. Users upload songs, vote in blind A/B comparisons, and compete in a 4-week churn system with Golden Ears awards for top judges.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 + Nuxt.js 3 + Pinia state management
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with custom RPC functions, triggers, and RLS policies
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for audio files and user avatars
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom profile management
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

## üéµ Core Music System

### Song Management
- **Upload System**: Drag & drop interface with rights confirmation
- **Metadata**: Title, artist, genre, clip start time, privacy settings
- **Storage**: 30-second battle clips stored in `song-audio` bucket
- **Privacy Controls**: Public/private visibility with granular privacy levels
- **Soft Delete**: 10-day trash system with restoration capability

### Genre System
- **Dynamic Genres**: Populated from active songs in real-time
- **Battle Availability**: Only genres with 2+ active songs available for battles
- **Leaderboards**: Separate rankings per genre with weekly updates
- **Genre Filtering**: Users can filter battles and leaderboards by genre

## ‚öîÔ∏è Battle System

### Battle Mechanics
- **Blind A/B Format**: Anonymous 30-second audio clips
- **Voting Interface**: Swipe or tap to choose winner
- **Song Selection**: Random pairing from active songs in same genre
- **Dynamic Audio**: HTML5 audio elements created/destroyed per battle
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during audio loading and voting
- **Wilson Score Ranking**: Statistical scoring system balancing approval rate with sample size confidence

### Battle Flow
1. **Genre Selection**: Choose from available genres
2. **Song Pairing**: Random selection from active songs
3. **Audio Loading**: Background loading with progress indicators
4. **User Voting**: Anonymous A vs B choice with button disabling
5. **Score Update**: Real-time like/dislike tracking
6. **Battle History**: User engagement and accuracy tracking

### Audio Management
- **Dynamic Creation**: Audio elements created per battle
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup after each battle
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for audio loading failures
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced handling for network instability

## üèÜ Competition & Scoring

### Churn System (4-Week Competition Cycle)
- **Week 0**: Songs enter competition (battles begin)
- **Weeks 1-3**: Active competition with weekly score updates
- **Week 4**: Final week, songs eliminated and moved to Hall of Fame
- **Monday Synchronization**: All songs start on Monday
- **Automated Processing**: Weekly churn advancement every Monday

### Scoring Algorithm
SongWars uses the Wilson Score Interval (lower bound) to rank songs. This balances a song's approval rate with confidence based on the number of votes, preventing low‚Äësample outliers from dominating.

```
Let p = likes / (likes + dislikes)
Let n = likes + dislikes
Let z = 1.96  (95% confidence)

WilsonLowerBound = (
  p + z^2/(2n) - z * sqrt( (p*(1-p) + z^2/(4n)) / n )
) / (1 + z^2/n)

Score = round( min(WilsonLowerBound * 100, 100), 2 )
If n = 0 ‚Üí Score = 50.00 (neutral)
```

Practical effects:
- Higher approval and more votes both increase the score.
- Songs with very few votes are conservatively ranked until more data is collected.

### Leaderboards
- **Weekly Rankings**: Top performers by genre (weeks 1-3)
- **Hall of Fame**: Final scores for eliminated songs (week 4+)
- **Churn Week Filtering**: Filter Hall of Fame by specific churn weeks
- **Per-Genre Limiting**: Fair representation (top 10 songs per genre)
- **Real-time Updates**: Live score tracking and ranking
- **Genre Filtering**: Separate rankings per music style
- **Wilson Score Ranking**: Statistical scoring within each genre
