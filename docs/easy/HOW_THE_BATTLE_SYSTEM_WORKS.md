# How the Battle System Works

## The Heart of SongWars

The battle system is the core feature that makes SongWars unique. It's how songs compete against each other in fair, anonymous head-to-head matchups that let the community decide what music deserves recognition.

## How Battles Work

### The Basic Process
1. **Genre Selection**: Users choose what type of music they want to judge
2. **Random Pairing**: Two songs are randomly selected from the same genre
3. **Anonymous Playback**: Both songs play for 30 seconds without revealing the artist
4. **Community Voting**: Users vote on which song they prefer
5. **Results Tracking**: Votes are recorded and songs move up or down in rankings

## How Songs Are Selected for Battles

### Random Selection Process
- **Database Query**: System searches for active songs in the chosen genre
- **Random Sampling**: Uses database random functions to select songs
- **Same Genre Only**: Songs are only paired with others in the same genre
- **Active Songs Only**: Only songs currently in competition are selected
- **No Bias**: Selection is completely random - no favoritism or algorithms

### Selection Criteria
- **Genre Match**: Songs must be in the exact same genre category
- **Active Status**: Songs must be currently participating in battles
- **Not Under Review**: Songs flagged for moderation are excluded
- **Not Soft Deleted**: Songs in trash are not selected
- **Public Songs**: Only publicly visible songs are chosen

### Fairness Guarantees
- **Equal Probability**: Every eligible song has the same chance of being selected
- **No History Bias**: Past performance doesn't affect selection
- **No User Bias**: Selection doesn't favor any particular user
- **Random Algorithm**: Uses cryptographically secure random selection
- **Fresh Pairings**: Songs are rarely paired with the same opponent twice

### Why This System is Fair
- **Complete Anonymity**: Voters never know who made the song
- **Equal Opportunity**: Every song gets the same chance to be heard
- **Community Decision**: The community, not industry gatekeepers, decides what's good
- **Random Pairing**: No favoritism or bias in song selection
- **Blind Judging**: Pure focus on the music itself

## The Battle Experience

### For Voters
When you enter a battle, you'll see:
- **Two song cards** side by side
- **Play buttons** to listen to each song
- **Vote buttons** to choose your favorite
- **Genre information** so you know what type of music you're judging
- **Visual feedback** showing your choice

### The Voting Process
1. **Listen to both songs** - each plays for 30 seconds
2. **Compare the music** - consider melody, lyrics, production, etc.
3. **Make your choice** - vote for the song you prefer
4. **See the results** - find out which song won
5. **Continue to next battle** - keep discovering new music

### What Happens After You Vote
- **Your vote is recorded** and counted toward the song's score
- **The winning song** gets points and moves up in rankings
- **The losing song** gets fewer points but stays in competition
- **Both songs** continue to compete in future battles
- **You can see** how your vote influenced the results

## The 4-Week Competition Cycle

### How Songs Progress
Songs don't just battle once - they compete in a structured tournament over 4 weeks:

**Week 1**: Songs enter the competition and start battling
**Week 2**: Songs continue battling and accumulating points
**Week 3**: Songs near the end of their competition cycle
**Week 4**: Songs complete their cycle and either advance or are eliminated

### What Determines Success
- **Win/Loss Record**: How many battles a song wins vs. loses
- **Vote Percentage**: What percentage of voters choose the song
- **Total Points**: Accumulated points from all battles
- **Community Engagement**: How much the community likes the song

### Advancement and Elimination
- **Top Performers**: Songs with the best records advance to higher levels
- **Elimination**: Songs that don't perform well are removed from competition
- **New Entries**: Fresh songs enter to replace eliminated ones
- **Continuous Cycle**: The competition never stops, always bringing new music

## The Roulette Wheel Experience

### The Exciting Start

## The Leaderboard System
