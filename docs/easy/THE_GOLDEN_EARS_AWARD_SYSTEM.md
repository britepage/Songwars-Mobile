# The Golden Ears Award System

## Recognizing Musical Excellence

The Golden Ears system is SongWars' way of recognizing and rewarding community members who have exceptional musical taste and judgment. It's our way of saying "thank you" to the people who consistently identify great music and help the community discover amazing artists.

## What Are Golden Ears Awards?

### The Concept
Golden Ears awards are special recognition given to community members who demonstrate:
- **Exceptional musical taste** - consistently identifying great music
- **Accurate judgment** - often picking songs that the community loves
- **Reliable voting** - participating regularly in battles
- **Community contribution** - helping discover amazing artists

### Why We Give These Awards
- **Recognize valuable contributors** who help the community
- **Encourage quality participation** in the voting process
- **Build reputation systems** that reward good judgment
- **Create incentives** for consistent engagement
- **Celebrate musical expertise** in the community

## How the System Works

### The Weekly Process
Every week, SongWars automatically:
1. **Analyzes all votes** from the previous week's battles
2. **Calculates accuracy scores** for each active voter
3. **Identifies top performers** who consistently pick winning songs
4. **Awards Golden Ears** to the most accurate judges
5. **Updates everyone's status** and recognition

### What Makes Someone Eligible
To earn Golden Ears awards, you need to:
- **Vote in at least 20 battles** during the week
- **Have a high accuracy rate** in your voting choices
- **Be in the top 25%** of all voters for that week
- **Participate consistently** in the community
- **Follow community guidelines** and voting rules

### How Accuracy is Calculated
Your accuracy score is based on:
- **How often you pick winning songs** in battles
- **How your votes align** with the community's choices
- **Consistency of your judgment** across different genres
- **Reliability of your participation** in voting
- **Overall contribution** to the community

### The Mathematical Formula
The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to calculate your accuracy:

**Base Accuracy Calculation:**
1. **Correct Votes**: Count of battles where you voted for the winning song
2. **Total Votes**: Total number of battles you participated in
3. **Base Score**: (Correct Votes รท Total Votes) ร 100

**Song Score Determination:**
- **Most Recent Score**: Uses each song's most recent performance score from the churn system
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Accounts for songs being in different churn weeks
- **Accurate Comparison**: Ensures fair evaluation based on current song performance

**Tie Handling:**
- **Tied Battles**: When songs have equal scores, you receive 0.5 credit
- **Partial Credit**: Ties count as half a correct vote toward your accuracy
- **Fair Assessment**: Prevents penalization for impossible-to-predict ties

**Final Accuracy Score:**
- **Base Score** + **Tie Adjustments** = **Final Accuracy Percentage**
- **Minimum 20 battles** required for qualification
- **Top 25%** of qualified voters receive awards
