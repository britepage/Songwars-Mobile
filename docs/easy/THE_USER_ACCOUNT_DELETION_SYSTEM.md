# The User Account Deletion System

## What is the User Account Deletion System?

The User Account Deletion System is SongWars' comprehensive solution for users who want to permanently remove their accounts and all associated data from the platform. It provides a secure, complete, and irreversible way to delete user accounts while ensuring all personal data and content are properly removed.

## How It Works

### Important: Immediate and Permanent Deletion

**⚠️ Critical Difference from Song Deletion**: Unlike song deletion (which has a 10-day grace period in the trash), account deletion is **IMMEDIATE and PERMANENT**. Once you confirm account deletion, there is NO grace period, NO recovery option, and NO way to undo it. Your account and all data are permanently removed the moment you confirm.

### The Deletion Process

**Step 1: User Initiates Deletion**
- User goes to their profile settings
- User clicks "Delete Account" option
- System shows comprehensive warning about permanent and immediate deletion
- User must type "DELETE" to confirm their intention

**Step 2: System Validation**
- System verifies user authentication
- System confirms user has permission to delete their account
- System prepares for comprehensive data cleanup
- System logs the deletion request for audit purposes

**Step 3: Complete Data Removal**
- System deletes all user songs and audio files
- System removes all user votes and battle participation
- System deletes user profile and preferences
- System removes all tagged songs and collections
- System cleans up all associated data and relationships

**Step 4: Final Cleanup**
- System removes all storage files (audio, avatars)
- System deletes authentication records
- System logs successful deletion
- User is automatically signed out and redirected

### What Gets Deleted

**User Data**
- Profile information and settings
- Username and display name
- Bio and personal details

- Musical preferences and settings
- Privacy and notification settings
