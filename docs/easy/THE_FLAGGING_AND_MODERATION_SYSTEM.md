# The Flagging and Moderation System

## What is the Flagging and Moderation System?

The Flagging and Moderation System is SongWars' way of keeping the platform safe, fair, and high-quality. It allows community members to report inappropriate content while giving administrators the tools to review and take action, ensuring that only appropriate and legally compliant content remains on the platform.

## How It Works

### The Flagging Process

**Step 1: User Reports Content**
- User encounters inappropriate or problematic content
- User clicks "More Actions" on the song
- User selects "Flag Song" from the dropdown
- User chooses a flag category and provides reason

**Step 2: System Processing**
- Flag is recorded in the database
- System checks if song meets threshold for review (5 flags triggers automatic review)
- Song status automatically changes to "under review" after 5 flags in any category
- Administrators are notified of flagged content

**Step 3: Admin Review**
- Administrators review flagged songs
- Administrators make decisions based on content
- Song status is updated based on decision
- Users are notified of outcomes

### Flag Categories

**Hate Speech**
- Content that promotes hatred or discrimination
- Offensive language targeting groups or individuals
- Content that incites violence or hostility
- Material that violates community standards

**Copyright Violation**
- Unauthorized use of copyrighted material
- Songs that don't belong to the uploader
- Content that infringes on intellectual property
- Material that violates copyright laws

### Automatic Review Threshold

**5-Flag Auto-Review System**
- Songs are automatically moved to "under review" status after receiving **5 flags** in any single category
- This prevents problematic content from remaining visible while awaiting manual admin review
- The threshold applies to each category independently (5 hate speech OR 5 copyright)
- Once under review, songs are temporarily removed from battles until admin decision
- This automatic system ensures rapid response to community concerns

**Why 5 Flags?**
- Prevents false positives from individual users
- Requires meaningful community consensus
- Balances speed with accuracy
- Reduces admin burden on clearly problematic content
- Provides community-driven moderation
