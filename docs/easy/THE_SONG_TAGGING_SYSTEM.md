# The Song Tagging System

## What is the Song Tagging System?

The Song Tagging System is SongWars' way of letting users create their own personal music collections. When users discover songs they love during battles, they can "tag" them to save them for later listening, creating a personalized library of their favorite discoveries.

## How It Works

### The Tagging Process

**Step 1: Discover a Song**
- User participates in a battle
- User listens to songs and finds one they love
- User wants to save the song for later

**Step 2: Tag the Song**
- User clicks "More Actions" on the song
- User selects "Tag Song" from the dropdown
- Song is added to their personal collection
- Visual feedback shows the song is now tagged

**Step 3: Access Tagged Songs**
- User goes to their account page
- User clicks on "Tagged Songs" section (only visible on their own profile)
- User sees all their saved songs
- User can play, untag, or manage their collection

### Visual Feedback System

**In Battles**
- Tagged songs show a "tagged" indicator
- "More Actions" dropdown shows "Untag" option
- Users can see which songs they've already saved
- Prevents duplicate tagging of the same song

**In Profile**
- Dedicated "Tagged Songs" section (private - only visible on your own profile)
- List of all saved songs with details
- Play buttons for each song
- Untag buttons to remove songs

## Privacy and Visibility
